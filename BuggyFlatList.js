In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error arises when using the `keyExtractor` prop incorrectly.  If the `keyExtractor` function doesn't return a unique key for each item, you might encounter unexpected behavior like incorrect rendering, component updates not reflecting changes, or performance issues.  The error might not always be immediately obvious, manifesting as seemingly random glitches in the list rendering.
